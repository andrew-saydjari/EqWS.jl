# DHC

These are temporary docs. Full versions will be available once a more stable version is established (said every developer ever). Due to active development, we recommend forking the repository to prevent changes in syntax from confounding users.

## Example

Please find an example notebook that runs DHC on image slices loaded from FITS files in from_cannon/2021_02_05. This is an example of the parallelized code suitable for computation across many cores on a single node (here 30). In this example, we calculated 2542 coeff per image on 800230 images in <2.5h. 

## Workflow

The main workflow (as of 2021/02/10) is to compute the filterbank using DHC.fink_filter_hash and then call DHC_compute(image,filterbank,filterbank).

The DHC currently computes second-order convolutions in direct analogy with WST, but always sums power (abs^2) over images rather than just summing the abs. Other second-order couplings are under development and are experimental. Passing the filterbank twice allows the user to specify a different filterbank for the first and second convolutions. This has not yielded particularly compelling results and will be deprecated (or at least made an implicit argument) in the near future.

## Method Parameters

Most of the parameters users will want to adjust are found in the compilation of the filterbank. A standard call looks like

`
filter_hash = fink_filter_hash(1,8,nx=256,wd=2)
`

The first argument (c) specifies the step size of scale (J) for the wavelets. For c=1, there are J = log_2(N_pixels)-2 radial bins. One bin near the origin of Fourier space is excluded because it is not well sampled (and it is compensated for by a catch all filter phi) and one bin near the edges of the Fourier plane is also excluded because it is not well sampled in real space. For c = 2, there are 2xJ radial bins, a half-dyadic spacing (higher c are implemented for those interested, but generally does seem to significantly improve the statistics at least for small images ~256^ pixels).

The second argument is L, the number of angular bins. Default should be L=8. We do sometimes run with L=16. 

The size of the image is assumed 256, but can be changed by passing nx=N_pix.

By default, our wavelets only have nearest neighbor overlap (wd=1), but we often find wavelets more extended in the angular direction improve performance (wd=2). This will be discussed in a forthcoming publication which should release the code and improve the docs.

Currently, pc=1 by default meaning that the L angular bins only tile 0 to \pi. However, pc=2 allows a full tiling 0 to 2\pi with L bins.

Other experimental features are generally breifly described under the function definition but should be viewed as highly experimental.

## Development

Please feel free to post issues and questions about the package or contact andrew.saydjari@cfa.harvard.edu directly. Your contributions are welcome. Just fork the repository and submit a pull request.

## FAQ

We are actively developing GPU capabilities but they are not yet implemented. Sparse 3D wavelets are also in process.
